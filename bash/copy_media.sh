#  Copy DCIM directory from newly mounted SD card or whatever
#
#  use fswatch on linux
#  use fswatch or Automator on OS X
#    to watch the parent directory where media are mounted
#    captured as $MEDIA_VOLUME in copy_properties.sh
#  first (and only) argument is the name of the head directory of the mounted card
#
#   This script searches for a DCIM directory in the head directory
#       if found it searches for a COPY file
#            if found it copies all files after the date of the COPY file
#            if not found it copies all files
#        copies those file to the $INBOUND directory
#        touches a COPY file to tag the date
