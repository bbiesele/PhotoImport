# PhotoImport
# Copy files from various media into a structured set of directories by date

# inbound.sh
# attach as folder action to a temporary directory
#   where new photos can be dropped
#   preceed with a prompt requiring user action on completion of copy
#   or else OS X may call this before all files are copied

# copy(_gopro _iphone, _pixel).sh scripts work in *nix os's. But not in OS X
